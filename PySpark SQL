This brach is dedicated to all the learnings i have done for the projects which i would be working subsequently 

Firstly im learning PySpark SQL


Project Idea: Analysis on resons why airline flights are delayed usign PySpark SQL

Objectives:

1) Understanding the causes of the flight delays and cancellations

2) Flight delay ->  1)It is caused when a flight is scheduled to departure after its orginally scheduled time of departure
                    2)It is also caused when a flight landed/arrived after its orginally scheduled time of arrival
3) Most of the planes are delayed due to system issues and airline delays

4) Lower amount of planes are delayed due incliment weather or security issues

5) Delayed flights or Cancelled flights cause a delay to the system

Tools used:

1) Google Cloud Platform -DataProc Deploying a cluster for processing data 
2) Jupyter Lab - Processing/ Scripting interface to launch and tryout pyspark-SQL code
3) PySparkSQL -- Used to process airline data
